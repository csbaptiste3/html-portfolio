<p>I recall being a young girl and sneaking to watch this film. Dancing was forbidden in my family and to see Johnny Castle teach Baby to break out of her shell was amazing!</p>
<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>

<p>Edward Lewis looking past Vivian's stature/profession and seeing who she truly was to her core made me fall in love with the possibility of love.</p>
<h3>Beyond The Lights</h3>

<p>Kazaam rescuing and overcoming his fears for the woman he loves. Challenging her to see all her potential. Enough said.</p>
